                Sri Vazhakarutheeswarar Temple is an ancient Hindu temple in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu, dedicated to Lord Shiva. The name literally means "The God who Solves Cases," and the temple is particularly known for helping devotees with legal issues and disputes. Legend says that Shiva resolved a dispute between the Devas and sages here, leading to its association with resolving conflicts.
